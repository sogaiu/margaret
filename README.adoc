= Margaret - Janet's peg/match in Janet
:toc:

This aims to be a pure-Janet implementation of Janet's `peg/match`.

== Background

While reading bakpakin's https://bakpakin.com/writing/how-janets-peg-works.html[How Janet's PEG module works], started typing the code in and evaluating it, next thing I knew...

== Status

In progress, see <<Specials Implementation Status>> for details.

== Why?

* Aid in understanding Janet's PEG system
* Generate example PEG specials usages
* Experiment with adding diagnostic info / tracing
* Experiment with additional constructs

== Setup

* Clone this repository and cd to the relevant directory

* Ensure `janet` and `jpm` are on your `PATH`

* Install if you like: `jpm install`

== Usage

`meg/match` is an attempt at implementing `peg/match`, so for example:

[source,janet]
----
(import margaret/meg)

(meg/match ~(capture (some "smile")) "smile!")
----
should work.

There is some support for diagnostic output via the dynamic variable `:meg-debug`, just do:

[source,janet]
----
(setdyn :meg-debug true)
----

before calling `meg/match`.  Output format is still evolving but likely will support at least:

. capture stack
. tags
. index into text
. specials execution order

== Testing

Run all tests by:

* Ensure https://gitlab.com/sogaiu/judge-gen[judge-gen] is installed (i.e. `jg` and `jg-verdict` are on your `PATH`)

* From the project directory of margaret: `jpm test`

There are currently tests for:

* link:margaret/meg.janet[margaret's `meg` module]

* link:margaret/tutorial.janet[`peg` module tutorial]

* link:margaret/article.janet[modified code from bakpakin's article]
