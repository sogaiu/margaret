= Margaret - Janet's peg/match in Janet
:toc:

This aims to be a pure-Janet implementation of Janet's `peg/match`.

== Background

While reading bakpakin's
https://bakpakin.com/writing/how-janets-peg-works.html[How Janet's PEG
module works], started typing the code in and evaluating it, next
thing I knew...

== Status

In progress, see <<Specials Implementation Status>> for details.

== Why?

* Aid in understanding Janet's PEG system
* Generate example PEG specials usages
* Experiment with adding diagnostic info / tracing
* Experiment with additional constructs

== Setup

* Clone this repository and cd to the relevant directory

* Ensure `janet` and `jpm` are on your `PATH`

* Install if you like: `jpm install`

== Usage

`meg/match` is an attempt at implementing `peg/match`, so for example:

[source,janet]
----
(import margaret/meg)

(meg/match ~(capture (some "smile")) "smile!")
----

should work.

There is some support for diagnostic output via the dynamic variable
`:meg-debug`.

To try it, do:

[source,janet]
----
(setdyn :meg-debug true)
----

or for more detailed info:

[source,janet]
----
(setdyn :meg-debug {:captures true
                    :peg true
                    :text true})
----

before calling `meg/match`.

Output format is still evolving but likely will support at least:

. capture stack
. tags
. specials execution order

== Testing

Run all tests by:

* `jpm test` from the project directory of margaret

There are currently tests for:

* link:margaret/meg.janet[margaret's `meg` module]

* link:examples/stand-alone/tutorial.janet[`peg` module tutorial]

* link:examples/stand-alone/article.janet[modified code from bakpakin's article]

Some of the tests were adapted / copied from Janet's tests.

== Implementation Notes

In many cases an attempt to follow the original
https://github.com/janet-lang/janet/blob/master/src/core/peg.c[`peg.c`]
implementation by bakpakin was made.  Some motivations for doing so
include:

. If `peg.c` changes, tracking those changes may be easier.

. If an experimentally added special in margaret proves useful, it
  might be easier to port it to `peg.c`.

. Arriving at a correct implementation might be easier because
  comparing it with a similar one is more meaningful.

. Debugging information obtained here might be more relevant when
  trying to understand a situation in the original `peg.c` context.

. Reading margaret's implementation might be an easier place to start
  if one wants to study `peg.c`.

Some differences include:

. `peg.c` creates a bytecode representation before execution and some
  information (e.g. tag names) is not retained.  In at least one case,
  some uses of `range` get compiled to the same type of bytecode
  instruction used by `set`.

. `peg.c` has protections for too much recursion.
