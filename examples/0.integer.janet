# `<n>` -- where <n> is an integer

# For n >= 0, try to match n characters, and if successful, advance
# that many characters.

# For n < 0, matches only if there aren't |n| characters, and do not
# advance.

# For example, -1 will match the end of a string because the length of
# the empty string is 0, which is less than 1 (i.e. |-1| = 1 and there
# aren't that many characters).
