# Parsing Expression Grammars
# ---------------------------

# PEGs, or Parsing Expression Grammars, are another formalism
# for recognizing languages.

# PEGs are easier to write than a custom parser and more
# powerful than regular expressions. They also can produce
# grammars that are easily understandable and fast.

# PEGs can also be compiled to a bytecode format that can be
# reused.

# Janet offers the `peg` module for writing and evaluating PEGs.

# (Janet's `peg` module borrows syntax and ideas from both LPeg
# and REBOL/Red parse module. Janet has no built-in regex module
# because PEGs offer a superset of the functionality of regular
# expressions.)

# The `peg` module
# ----------------

# The `peg` module uses the concept of a capture stack to extract
# data from text.

# As the PEG is trying to match a piece of text, some forms may
# push Janet values onto the capture stack as a side effect.

# If the text matches the PEG, `peg/match` will return the final
# capture stack as an array.

(type peg/match)
# => :cfunction

# The `peg/match` function
# ------------------------

# `(peg/match peg text
#             &opt start
#             & args)`

# Match a PEG against some text.

# Returns an array of captured data if the text matches.

(peg/match "cat" "cat")
# => @[]

# N.B. 1. matching succeeded and the returned array is the 
#         capture stack

# N.B. 2. array is empty because there was a match, but no 
#         capture

(peg/match ~(capture "cat") "cat")
# => @["cat"]

# N.B. matching succeeded and there was a capture, so the 
#      returned array (capture stack) is not empty

# `peg/match` returns nil if there is no match.

(peg/match "cat" "ca")
# => nil

# N.B. matching was not successful so the return value is nil

# The caller of `peg/match` can provide an optional start index 
# to begin matching, otherwise the PEG starts on the first 
# character of text.

(peg/match "cat" "cat" 0)
# => @[]

(peg/match "cat" "cat")
# => @[]

(peg/match "cat" "notcat" 3)
# => @[]

(peg/match "cat" "notcat" 2)
# => nil

# A PEG can either be a compiled PEG object or PEG source.

# N.B. examples before this point have been using "PEG source"

(type (peg/compile "cat"))
# => :core/peg

(let [cat-peg (peg/compile "cat")]
  [(peg/match cat-peg "cat")
   (peg/match cat-peg "category")])
# => [@[] @[]]

# The variadic `args` argument to `peg/match` is used by the
# as-yet-unintroduced capture form `argument` and will be 
# described later.

# Primitive Patterns
# ------------------

# Larger patterns are built up with primitive patterns, which 
# recognize:

#   * string literals
#   * individual characters
#   * a given number of characters

# A character in Janet is considered a byte, so PEGs will work 
# on any string of bytes.

# No special meaning is given to the 0 byte, or the string 
# terminator as in many languages.

# String Patterns
# ---------------

# Matches a literal string, and advances a corresponding number of characters.

# N.B. "advances" refers to an increase in the value of the current position
#      under consideration of the target text as matching is carried out
#      according to the PEG.

#      The "current position" of the text is relevant because it affects
#      matching.

#      The conditions under which "advancing" occurs vary, but should be
#      described in the documentation.

(peg/match "cat" "cat")
# => @[]

(peg/match "cat" "cat1")
# => @[]

(peg/match "" "")
# => @[]

(peg/match "" "a")
# => @[]

(peg/match "cat" "dog")
# => nil

# Integer Patterns
# ----------------

# Matches a number of characters, and advances that many characters.

(peg/match 3 "cat")
# => @[]

(peg/match 2 "cat")
# => @[]

(peg/match 4 "cat")
# => nil

# If negative, matches if not that many characters and does not advance.

# For example, -1 will match the end of a string because the length of
# the empty string is 0, which is less than 1 (i.e. "not that many
# characters").

(peg/match -1 "cat")
# => nil

(peg/match -1 "")
# => @[]

(peg/match -2 "")
# => @[]

(peg/match -2 "o")
# => @[]

# Range Patterns
# --------------

# Matches characters in a range and advances 1 character.

(peg/match '(range "ac") "b")
# => @[]

# N.B. in this case the grammar needs to be quoted

(peg/match ~(range "ac") "b")
# => @[]

# N.B. using quasiquoting (~) means unquoting can be used within
#      the grammar expression

(let [a-range "ac"]
  (peg/match ~(range ,a-range) "b"))
# => @[]

# Multiple ranges can be combined together.

(let [text (if (< (math/random) 0.5)
               "b"
               "y")]
  (peg/match ~(range "ac" "xz") text))
# => @[]

# Set Patterns
# ------------

# Match any character in the argument string. Advances 1 character.

(peg/match ~(set "cat") "cat")
# => @[]

(peg/match ~(set "act!") "cat!")
# => @[]

(peg/match ~(set "bo") "bob")
# => @[]

# Combining Patterns
# ------------------

# The primitive patterns can be combined with several combinators to match
# a wide number of languages.

# These combinators can be thought of as the looping and branching forms in
# a traditional language (that is how they are implemented when compiled
# to bytecode).

# `choice` aka `+`
# ----------------

# `(choice a b ...)`

# Tries to match a, then b, and so on.

# Will succeed on the first successful match,

(peg/match ~(choice "a" "b") "a")
# => @[]

(peg/match ~(choice "a" "b") "b")
# => @[]

# and fails if none of the arguments match the text.

(peg/match ~(choice "a" "b") "c")
# => nil

# `(+ a b c ...)` is an alias for `(choice a b c ...)`

(peg/match ~(+ "a" "b") "a")
# => @[]

# `sequence` aka `*`
# ------------------

# `(sequence a b c ...)`

# Tries to match a, b, c and so on in sequence.

(peg/match ~(sequence "a" "b" "c") "abc")
# => @[]

(peg/match ~(sequence "a" "b" "c") "abcd")
# => @[]

# If any of these arguments fail to match the text, the whole pattern fails.

(peg/match ~(sequence "a" "b" "c") "abx")

# => @[]

# `any`
# -----

# `(any patt)`

# Matches 0 or more repetitions of `patt`

# ------

# `(some patt)`

# Matches 1 or more repetitions of `patt`

(peg/match ~(some "a") "aa")

# `between` and `opt` / `?`
# -------------------------

# `(between min max patt)`

# Matches between `min` and `max` (inclusive) repetitions of `patt`

(peg/match ~(between 1 3 "a") "aa")
# => @[]

(peg/match ~(between 0 8 "b") "")
# => @[]

(peg/match ~(sequence (between 0 2 "c") "c")
           "ccc")
# => @[]

(peg/match ~(sequence (between 0 3 "c") "c")
           "ccc")
# => nil

# `(opt patt)` and `(? patt)` are aliases for `(between 0 1 patt)`

(peg/match ~(? "a") "a")

# `at-least`
# ----------

# `(at-least n patt)`

# Matches at least n repetitions of patt

(peg/match ~(at-least 3 "z") "zz")

(peg/match ~(at-least 3 "z") "zzz")
# => @[]

# `at-most`
# ---------

# `(at-most n patt)`

# Matches at most n repetitions of patt
(peg/match ~(at-most 3 "z") "zz")
# => @[]

(peg/match ~(sequence (at-most 3 "z") "z")

           "wink")

# `not` aka `!`
# -------------

# `look` aka `>`
# --------------

# `(look offset patt)`

# Matches only if `patt` matches at a fixed offset.

# `offset` can be any integer.

           "my cat")
# => @[]

# `to`
# ----

# `(to patt)`

# Match up to `patt` (but not including it).

# pattern does not match.

(peg/match ~(to "\n")
           "this is a nice line\n")
# => @[]

# `backmatch`
# -----------

# `(backmatch ?tag)`

# If `tag` is provided, matches against the tagged capture.

# The peg advances if there was a match.

# XXX: these examples use `capture` which really hasn't been introduced yet

(peg/match ~(sequence (capture "a" :target)

           "abbba")
# => @["a" "a"]

# Greediness and Backtracking
# ---------------------------

# PEGs try to match an input text with a pattern in a greedy manner.

# This means that if a rule fails to match, that rule will fail and not try
# again.

# The only backtracking provided in a PEG is provided by the
# `(choice x y z ...)` special, which will try rules in order until one
# succeeds, and the whole pattern succeeds.

# If no sub-pattern succeeds, then the whole pattern fails.

# Note that this means that the order of `x` `y` `z` in `choice` does matter.

# If `y` matches everything that `z` matches, `z` will never succeed.

# Captures
# --------

# Capture specials will only push captures to the capture stack if their
# child pattern matches the text.

# Most captures specials will match the same text as their first argument
# pattern.

# In addition, most specials that produce captures can take an optional
# argument `tag` that applies a keyword tag to the capture.

# These tagged captures can then be recaptured via the `(backref tag)`
# special in subsequent matches.

# Tagged captures, when combined with the `cmt` special, provide a powerful
# form of look-behind that can make many grammars simpler.

# `capture` aka `<-` or `quote`
# -----------------------------

# `(capture patt ?tag)`

# Capture all of the text in `patt` if `patt` matches.

# If `patt` contains any captures, then those captures will be pushed on to
# the capture stack before the total text.

# XXX: if `capture` had been introduced much earlier, certain parts of the
#      docs might have made more sense at the time (e.g. bits that refer
#      to capturing)

# Grammars and Recursion
# ----------------------

# The feature that makes PEGs so much more powerful than pattern matching
# solutions like (vanilla) regex is mutual recursion.

# To do recursion in a PEG, you can wrap multiple patterns in a grammar,
# which is a Janet struct.

# The patterns must be named by keywords, which can then be used in all
# sub-patterns in the grammar.

# Each grammar, defined by a struct, must also have a main rule, called
# `:main`, that is the pattern that the entire grammar is defined by.

(def my-grammar
  '{:a (* "a" :b "a")
    :b (* "b" (+ :a 0) "b")
    :main (* "(" :b ")")})

# alternative expression of `my-grammar`
(def my-grammar-alt
  '{# :b wrapped in parens
    :main (sequence "("
                    :b
                    ")")
    # :a or nothing wrapped in lowercase b's
    :b (sequence "b"
                 (choice :a 0)
                 "b")
    # :b wrapped in lowercase a's
    :a (sequence "a"
                 :b
                 "a")})

# simplest match
(peg/match my-grammar-alt "(bb)")
# => @[]

# next simplest match
(peg/match my-grammar-alt "(babbab)")
# => @[]

# non-match
(peg/match my-grammar-alt "(baab)")
# => nil

# Recursion and Stack Limit
# -------------------------

# Keep in mind that recursion is implemented with a stack, meaning that
# very recursive grammars can overflow the stack.

# The compiler is able to turn some recursion into iteration via tail-call
# optimization, but some patterns may fail on large inputs.

# It is also possible to construct (very poorly written) patterns that will
# result in long loops and be very slow in general.

# Built-in Patterns
# -----------------

# The `peg` module also provides a default grammar with a handful of
# commonly used patterns.

# All of these shorthands can be defined with the combinators above and
# primitive patterns, but you may see these aliases in other grammars and
# they can make grammars simpler and easier to read.

# All of these aliases are defined in `default-peg-grammar`, which is a table
# that maps from the alias name to the expanded form.

# You can even add your own aliases here which are then available for all
# PEGs in the program.

# Modifiying this table will not affect already compiled PEGs.

# String Searching and Other Idioms
# ---------------------------------

# Although all pattern matching is done in anchored mode, operations like
# global substitution and searching can be implemented with the `peg`
# module.

# A simple Janet function that prodces PEGs that search for strings shows
# how captures and looping specials can be composed, and how quasiquoting
# can be used to embed values in patterns.

# There are also built-ins:

#   `peg/find`
#   `peg/find-all`
#   `peg/replace`
#   `peg/replace-all`

# Footnotes
# ---------

# [*] The phrase "not produce ... captures" seems misleading as
#     the combinators themselves do not produce captures, but
#     "arguments" (e.g. `cond`, `patt`, etc.) can (e.g. if
#     `patt` is `(capture "a")` and `patt` succeeds).
