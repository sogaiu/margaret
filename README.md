# Margaret - Janet's peg/match in Janet

This aims to be a pure-Janet implementation of Janet's `peg/match`.

Apart from having fun, here are some reasons [why](doc/why.md) this
could be of some interest.

## Setup

* Clone this repository and cd to the relevant directory

* Ensure `janet` and `jpm` are on your `PATH`

* Install if you like: `jpm install`

## Usage

### Basic Use

`meg/match` is an attempt at implementing `peg/match`, so for example,
if `margaret` has already been installed:

```janet
(import margaret/meg)

(meg/match ~(capture (some "smile")) "smile!")
```

should work.

### Tracing

There is some primitive support for tracing.  It can be enabled by
setting the `VERBOSE` environment variable to a non-empty string.

Either:

* set the `VERBOSE` env var (say to "1") before starting `janet`, or
* use `(os/setenv "VERBOSE" "1")` in code

before calling `meg/match`.

Output format is very much in-flux but ATM one can see:

* capture stack
* tags
* specials execution order

...and other details.

See [here](doc/tracing.md) for more.
