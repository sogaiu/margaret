# questions
#
# X. peg_call_reset doesn't touch tagged_captures...is that ok?
# Y. how to address the problem of testing / exploring code with
#    "inner" definitions (e.g. defn within a defn)

# notes
#
# XXX: think about how to improve tests
#      * adapt from janet suite
#      * look elsewhere?
#      * try to think of and cover boundary cases
#      * try to use specials in combination
#      * consider how to exercise meg
#      * some candidate repositories to look for pegs and tests / usages of
#        pegs:
#        * andrewchambers' janet-httpkit
#        * andrewchambers' janet-shlex
#        * andrewchambers' janet-uri
#        * bakpakin's mendoza
#        * bakpakin's x43bot
#        * bakpakin's spork/fmt, spork/regex, spork/temple (need too much?)
#        * crocket's janet-utf8
#        * Duncaen's dhall-janet
#        * ikarius' bencode
#        * MikeBeller's janet-benchmarksgame
#        * pepe's chidi
#        * pepe's neil (time-grammar, date-grammars)
#        * pyrmont's tomlin
#        * pyrmont's musty
#        * staab's janet-schema (uuid-pattern and others?)
#        * zenlor's janet-csv
#      * find other pegs to test and test
# XXX: go through source looking for XXX, and collect here
# XXX: RULE_BETWEEN's max value is not currently correct.  is it ok
#      to use a non-integer for it?
# XXX: try to improve log-entry and log-exit -- should there just be a
#      single dictionary argument?
# XXX: tco
# XXX: consider an introspective / debugging repl
#      * entry and exit points of each special seem possible to support
#        without too much difficulty
#      * how about other locations?
# XXX: possibly support other peg/* functions?
# XXX: support configurability of JANET_INT_TYPES processing for RULE_READINT
# XXX: compilation idea
#      * meg/compile generates something like meg/match, then
#        meg/match just executes
# XXX: consider having an analysis / rewriting / transformation phase
#      * determine value for has_backref
#      * rewriting of the peg expressed in 47 specials to only use the
#        30 specials
#        * behavior will more closely match c implementation
#        * implementing the following might be easier:
#          * ?
#          * any
#          * at-least
#          * at-most
#          * int
#          * int-be
#          * opt
#          * repeat
#          * some
#          * uint
#          * uint-be
#      * if the peg is turned into a different representation it may
#        be possible to retain information such as what the original
#        special was (e.g. `any`) and/or create a "source map"
#      * possibly it might be easier to mirror the c implementation
#        more closely
#      * determine whether position -> line, col table necessary
#      * any other benefits?
# XXX: consider rewriting
#      * try to use non-internal definitions to ease testing / exploration
#      * easier to use macros(?)
# XXX: consider rewriting some parts to more closely resemble the c
#      implementation (e.g. `range`, `set`, and other things?)
# XXX: bounds checking for things like `look`
# XXX: review the spec_* functions and compare with meg.janet
# XXX: track current position in string?

# Captures are implemented as a stack, and some combinators will pop
# captures from the stack - the fact that a capture is referenced by
# backref or has a tag does not change that. This is why accumulate and
# group get rid of the tagged capture and cause backref to fail.
#
# One interesting solution is to use separate stacks for tagged captures
# and normal captures.  Combinators like accumulate and group could then
# reset the normal capture stack on success, but keep the tagged capture
# stack as is. On match failure, you would still reset both stacks
# though. The only purpose of the tagged capture stack would be to
# support backref.
